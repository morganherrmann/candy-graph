# candy-graph
A javascript program using D3 that turns a file in JSON format into a clean, stylized node representation.  Works best for data showing nodes, connections, and groups.

Nodes are responsive to click-and-drag events and stablize with a gravity simulation.

Sample JSON file included as graphFile.json
